## Why are you building The Matrix?

To explore the full development stack of other environments, from serving up
HTTP responses to unit testing conventions to standard database conventions.

All projects should be considered permanently WIP while I continuously build up
the RAML documentation that describes what each project should adhere to, as
well as keeping up with the continuing evolution of web development in the above
said stacks.
